            <p>WOODLANDS are found in parts of
                the world that have a temperate
                climate, with warm summers but cool
                winters. In western Europe, the eastern
                USA and eastern Asia, woodland is mainly
                deciduous.</p><div class="content-forest">
                    <p>In winter, the trees lose their
                    leaves and shut down their growth.This allows them to conserve water and survive
                    the cold. Further north are the coniferous,
                    or boreal, forests of Russia and North
                    America. Their trees have needle-like leaves
                    and a conical shape, to shed heavy snow
                    that could break their branches.
                    The plants and animals that live in the
                    woodlands also have to survive the winter.
                    Food becomes scarce as plants die back and
                    fruits and seeds are no longer abundant.
                    Some animals hibernate in sheltered tree
                    holes or underground burrows, only stirring
                    with the new growth of spring. Others
                    store enough food during the autumn to
                    last them through the winter.
                    Notable animals you can find there are:
                    Red squirrel,
                    Green woodpecker.
                     Tawny owl,
                     Dormouse,
                     Roe deer,
                     Grey squirrel,
                     Jay,
                     Badger,
                    Rabbit,
                    Stoat,
                     Blackbird,
                    Great tit,
                     Song thrush,
                     Fox,
                     Hedgehog...
                    Unlike the dense roof of a tropical
                    rainforest, the canopy of a deciduous wood
                    lets some light reach the woodland floor,
                    creating a layer of thick, varied ground
                    vegetation. In damp areas, rich green moss
                    coats the trees.
                    During autumn, fallen leaves build up
                    into a thick layer on the ground, providing
                    insects, worms and small mammals with a
                    warm hibernation site. There is always
                    danger, however, from digging predators
                    such as foxes. In the spring, insects and
                    other invertebrates feed on the leaf litter,
                    breaking it down into nutrients in the soil,
                    where it is taken up by growing plants. 
                    CONIFEROUS WOODLANDS Conifers constantly lose and replace their leaves, or needles, throughout the year. The dead leaves are not broken down into the soil because worms and other soil-enriching invertebrates find them distastful. Instead, they remain as a thick layer of leaf litter, making the soil acidic and poor. Forest berries and fungi provide food for birds and mammals. Crossbills use their specially adapted beaks to prise open pine cones and reach the nutritious seeds inside. Conifer trees provide animals with shelter and some warmth during the winter. At one time woodlands covered huge areas of Europe, North America and Asia. Much deciduous woodland has been cut down to grow crops on its rich soil. Areas of coniferous forest, with its poor soil, still remain in Asia and North America. The vast coniferous forests of northern Russia are known as the taiga. During the winter, animals that feed on the northern tundra during the short summer, such as elk and reindeer, shelter in the forest, scraping away the snow to feed on mosses. The lynx and goshawk prey on small mammals. The brown bear hibernates until spring.

                    SAVANNA grasslands are found close to the Equator, outside the belt of tropical rainforests. The largest and best-known savanna grasslands are in Africa, although there are also areas in South America, India and northern Australia.
Savanna is dominated by grass, but the landscape is also scattered with bushes and trees. 
The climate is hot, with a dry season followed by a rainy season.

                </p><div class="content-forest">
                        <p>The vast expanses of grass in the African savanna supports a wide range of grazing animals such as wildbeest, zebras and gazelles. Other plant-eaters, such as elephants, giraffes and black rhinoceroses, are browsers, feeding on vegetation from bushes and trees. Both browsers and grazers avoid competition for food by feeding at different levels. The girrafe`s long neck and the elephant`s trunk allow them to reach up to the highest leaves, while smaller animals feed lower down. Among the grazers, zebras and buffaloes tear off the coarse top shoots of the grass. The wildbeets then feed on the leafy layer below, leaving the tender shoots at the base for the gazzelles. 
                            Most of the African plant-eaters live in herds, for protection against predators. They move from place to place, according to where grass and water can be found. When dry season begins, they migrate in a vast mass from their breeding grounds in the south to wetter areas in the north and west. 
                            The herds of plant-eaters provide food for many savanna carnivores, including lions, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas and wild dogs. The larger carnivores can kill large plant-eaters such as wildbeets. Smaller, less powerful hunters feed on antelopes and gazzelles, rodents and other small animals. Birds of prey swoop down on their victims out of the sky, or from treetops.
                            After the hunters have eaten their fill, the scavenge from the remains of others, their strong jaws able to crush even bones. Vultures spot the carcass as they circle in the skies, and come down to feed, drawing the attention of other scavengers, marabou storks and jackals.  The final scraps are removed by flies and beetles.
                            Insects are very important to life on the savanna, especially in this ''clearing up'' process.
                            Dung beetles remove animal dung, on which they feed and lay their eggs. Termites take dead plant matter into their nests, where they grow fungus on it to eat.
                            Steppes are the treeless grasslands of Asia. They are cold because they are exposed to winds from the Arctic. They are home to many animals including the saiga antelope, the Prezwalski horse and the marmot.
Pampas are the grasslands of South America, east of the Andes mountains. The weather in the pampas is mild with fairly regular rainfall. Frequent wildfires prevent large bushes or trees from establishing themselves, so long grass is the main vegetation. The pampas are home to a variety of birds and other animals, such as maned wolves and the ostrich-like rhea.
Prairies are the flat, treeless grasslands of North America. The prairies are hot in the summer and cool in the winter. They are home to many animals, including bison, snakes, birds and small mammals such as prairie dog

                        <p> 
                            Areas of TROPICAL RAINFORESTS are found near the Equator, in regions with a hot climate and high level of rainfall all year round. The most extensive rainforests are found in Central Africa, South America, Southeast Asia and the island of Madagascar. There are also small areas of rainforest in Australia and Central America. Tropical rainforests are the richest of all environments in terms of plant and animal life. Today, large areas of rainforest are being cut down, both to supply the timber industry and to make room for farming, roads, quarries and housing.
                        </p><div class="content-forest">
                                <p>The rainforest is made up of several different layers, like the storeys of a skyscraper. At the highest level is the emergent layer, made up of the tallest trees, some of which can reach 70 metres in height. This is a bright, windy layer, where birds and bats swoop, feeding on insects, fruits and flowers. Below the emergent layer is the canopy, an almost continuous “roof ” of branches and foliage. Here, in the warm sunlight, fruits and flowers grow, and many animals feed on them. Lower still is a shadier area known as the understorey, where animals fly, leap, climb or glide between the trees. Smaller plants that could not survive on the dark forest floor root themselves in pockets of decaying matter among branches, using the trees as a support to reach up towards the light.
                                    At the level of the forest floor, little light can penetrate down through the thick canopy. The atmosphere is dark and still, and ground vegetation is scarce. Only in places where a tree has fallen to create a clearing, or along the banks of a river, can ground vegetation find enough light to grow.
                                    Foliage constantly falls down onto the forest floor from the trees above, forming a layer of decaying plant matter. This is quickly broken up by insects that live and feed among it, so that it becomes a rich source of nutrients for the surrounding trees to take into their roots. The insects themselves are food for birds and ground dwelling forest animals, such as rodents and lizards. These small animals are, in turn, hunted by larger predators, such as snakes and cats, some of which will often lie in wait on low branches, ready to drop down on to their unsuspecting prey.
                                    Large plant-eaters such as elephants and gorillas also feed on the forest floor, pulling foliage from the lower branches. Rivers full of fish run through the forests, and are sources of food and water for many animals. Some animals, like the capybara, also leap into the water to escape from predators.

                                The highest mountaintops are covered with snow all year round.
Those that lie in tropical regions, such as Kilimanjaro in Africa, can have hot, steamy 
rainforest at their foothills and freezing  night-time temperatures at their summits. At high altitudes the sunlight is intense. 

                            </p><div class="content-forest">
                                    <p>There are strong, cold winds and a lack of oxygen in the air. Despite these dangers, mountains can host a wide variety of life. Both animals and plants have adapted to live in such harsh conditions. On tropical mountains, some species of plants and animals have developed in isolation.
                                        The plants are not able to spread their seeds far enough to reach another mountain, and even the animals cannot migrate from one mountain to another, because of the inhospitable heat in the lowlands.
                                        On their lower slopes, mountains are often forested, but higher up the trees give way to dry scrubland and rocky, windswept terrain. The flowering plants that grow here are short and strong, and are able to conserve water as much as possible in the drying winds. 
                                        Close to the summit, only the  most hardy kinds of plants, such as lichens and mosses, can grow.
                                        With the coming of spring, snow covering much of the mountain may melt and new plants emerge.
                                        
                                        Insects abound on the mountains during the warmer summer months, but many are flightless, as they would be swept away by the strong winds. Even in the snow-covered high peaks, insects and spiders survive.
                                        They feed on frozen insects that are blown up from the lowlands by the winds. Small mammals such as the pika in Asia, or the rock hyrax in Africa, live in burrows or rocky outcrops, to protect themselves
                                        from the worst of the cold and wind. Many also hibernate during the winter. Larger animals have thick fur or woolly coats to keep out the cold. Grazing animals, such as sheep and goats, live at the highest altitudes.
                                        Their nimble hooves are able to negotiate even the most treacherous slopes. They are preyed upon by wolves, snow leopards and cougars or mountain lions. Only the strongest-flying birds, such as eagles and other birds of prey, are able to withstand the winds around the mountain summits. 
                                        They soar on currents of air, swooping down to catch rodents and other small mammals

                                    DESERTS
With little or no rainfall, and often searingly hot temperatures, deserts are some of the most inhospitable places on Earth. Some deserts, especially those close to the Equator, are hot all year round, with temperatures sometimes reaching 50˚C. Others, such as the Gobi desert in Mongolia, are cold and windswept. 

                                </p><div class="content-forest">
                                        <p>There, high mountains act as a barrier to any warm, moist air currents, and temperatures can fall to -20˚C in winter. Many deserts are bare and rocky with areas of sparse scrubland, where only the hardiest plants can grow. As plants need water to survive, they must conserve as much as they can. Desert plants such as cacti have adapted the way they carry out photosynthesis, opening their stomata (pores) to take in carbon dioxide only in the cool of the night. Their thick, swollen stems also help to reduce water loss. Other desert plants keep most of their bulk in root systems underground, out of the sun’s heat. Some hot deserts are sandy, and the wind sweeps the sand into huge wave-like dunes. In these arid, bare landscapes, the sand is mostly too unstable to support plant life. Sometimes an underground water source comes close to the surface, creating an oasis, where plants can grow, and people can live.
                                            Despite the barren landscape, a surprising variety of animal life can be found in the desert. The biggest problems facing these animals are the heat and the lack of water. Small mammals such as kangaroo rats and ground squirrels spend the day sheltering from the hot sun underground, coming out to feed only at night. Reptiles, on the other hand, need to warm up in the sun before they can become active enough to hunt, so they cannot feed at night.
                                            Instead, they shelter in burrows or rock crevices during the hottest part of the day, basking and feeding during the cooler early morning and evening. Some large mammals, such as camels, have thick coats on their backs to keep out the heat, and thinner hair on their bellies which lets excess heat out of the body. They can also conserve water inside their bodies, needing to take in very little to survive. Some carnivorous animals get all the water they need from their food, while birds can fly long distances in search of water.

                                        RIVERS hold a very small proportion of the Earth’s water, but they are extremely important habitats for many kinds of animals. At their source, usually in the mountains, rivers are fast-flowing, and plants cannot root themselves in the river bed. 
                                    </p><div class="content-forest">
                                            <p>The main source of food for invertebrates, such as water-living snails, leeches and fly larvae, is decaying plant material. This is washed downstream from vegetation that overhangs the river, and is filtered from the water by the invertebrates as they cling to the rocky river bed. Birds and strong-swimming fish then feed on the invertebrates.  Salmon are born in rivers, then swim out to the sea. They return to the rivers to lay their eggs,
                                                swimming and leaping upstream against the current.Further downstream, as the gradient lessens, a river is slower-moving. The mud and silt that collect on the river bottom form a bed for plants to take root. Worms and snails burrow into the mud, while insects and their larvae feed on the plants and the algae that grow on them. They in turn become prey for fish and frogs. Plants also provide protection from predators for newly-hatched fish, amphibians and insects.
                                                PONDS AND LAKES The still, calm waters of ponds and lakes are an ideal habitat for microscopic floating plants known as algae. They are fed upon by tiny animals, called zooplankton, which are then eaten by insects, snails and small fish. In small ponds, the major predators are newts and frogs, while fish can be found in larger ponds and lakes. Tall water plants take root in the bottom. They provide insect larvae with a “ladder” out of the water when they emerge to become adults.

                                            OCEANS
                                            The richest variety of life in the oceans is found in the surface waters. Here, light from the sun penetrates the water, allowing plants to grow. Unlike land plants, oceanic plants cannot put down roots into the ground.
                                            
                                        </p><div class="content-forest">
                                                <p> Instead, they drift through the water in the form of tiny, usually single-celled organisms, known as phytoplankton. 
                                                    They use sunlight and nutrients dissolved in the water to make food by the process of photosynthesis. Phytoplankton comprise most of the plant material found in the oceans (a small amount also comes from seaweeds and shallow-water marine grasses). Able to grow very quickly, they are the first and vital stage in the food web of the oceans. Phytoplankton are fed upon by tiny animals called zooplankton. These include the larvae (young) of fish, as well as tiny relatives of crabs and shrimps, known as copepods. They rise and fall through the water, using the surface currents to carry them along to new grazing areas. Plankton is richest in those parts of the ocean where nutrients are stirred up from the ocean floor by currents or winds, such as on the continental shelf . In some oceans, the amount of plankton in the water peaks in the spring and autumn. Many plankton-eating animals breed or migrate to coincide with these peaks. Zooplankton provide food for a wide range of ocean animals. In an attempt to escape attention, many zooplankton have confusing colour patterns, and some are even transparent. Fish and squid are major predators of zooplankton, and shoals of small fish throng the surface waters. They in turn attract larger predators. The Portuguese man-of-war floats on the surface, trailing its stinging tentacles down to catch small fish.
                                                    Sea birds glide over the ocean waves, looking out for fish. Some birds scoop up fish from the surface with their beaks or feet, while others, such as the booby, dive right into the water to grab their prey. Below the surface, small fish are preyed upon by larger, fast-moving predatory fish, such as tuna or sharks. They also fall prey to sea turtles, and mammals such as seals, dolphins and whales.
                                                    With so many different predators, many fish have evolved patterns of colour for camouflage, or spiny or armoured skin, for protection. The surface waters are home to some of the largest animals in the world. Many of these, however, feed on the smallest creatures of all, zooplankton. Baleen whales, such as the blue whale or the sei whale, as well as some sharks like the basking shark, take in great mouthfuls of water and filter out vast quantities of a shrimp-like zooplankton called krill.

                                            <p> POLAR BIOMS
                                                Much of the Arctic Ocean is covered with a thick layer of floating ice all year round. At its edges, rafts of broken ice, called pack ice, drift in the freezing cold waters.</p>
                                                
                                           <div class="content-forest">
                                                    <p> During the summer, some of the ice cracks and melts, forming waterways and large stretches of water. No plants can grow on the Arctic ice, so most life is found in the waters around it. During the summer, the days become longer, and the sun warms the waters. Phytoplankton, tiny plant material that floats in the water, quickly grows and multiplies in these conditions, providing food for millions of tiny animals called zooplankton. With the sudden increase in zooplankton, many animals migrate to the Arctic during the summer to exploit this rich source of food. Fish, squid, birds and even giant whales feed on the zooplankton. A shrimplike kind called krill is a particular favourite. Seals hunt the fish, while walruses search for shellfish and crabs on the sea bed with their sensitive whiskers. The largest predators in the waters are killer whales, which feed on fish and seals, while on the ice the huge polar bear roams. Its white coat is perfect camouflage while it waits to grab a seal as it emerges from a hole in the ice to breathe.
                                                        In winter, most of the ocean freezes over again, and the days are short and dark. Without sunshine to make food, phytoplankton cannot grow. Zooplankton sink into the depths of the ocean, where they feed on one another, or off fat reserves stored during the summer. Most of the larger animals migrate south to find new sources of food. Polar bears are among the few animals that remain. Some roam the ice or nearby land during the winter, while others dig dens in the snow to shelter from the harsh weather until the spring. Here females give birth to their cubs.
                                                        The lan that borders the Arctic Ocean is treeless, and the soil is permanently frozen. For most of the year, this region, known as tundra, is a barren wilderness, where plant and animal life is scarce. During the short summer, however, the ice in the top layer of the ground melts, and small plants can grow.
                                                         Herds of caribou or reindeer arrive from the taiga forests to the south, to feed on the new growth. The melted ice forms boggy patches where insects thrive, providing food for migrant birds. Small mammals such as lemmings that have spent the winter beneath the snow, are preyed upon by Arctic foxes and owls.
                                                        
                                                        THE CONTINENT of Antarctica is a huge, mountainous landmass, much of it covered by a permanent icecap almost three kilometres thick in some places. It is the coldest place in the world. In winter, the waters of the Southern Ocean surrounding the continent are covered with floating pack ice and icebergs that have broken off the edges of the coastal ice shelf. 
                                                        Bitter winds sweep up snow from the ground into fierce blizzards. The only places where plants can grow on this barren land are along the coasts and around the Antarctic Peninsula. Even then, they are mostly tiny mosses and lichens growing on the rocks. There is not enough food on the land to feed anything larger than small insects, so the animals of Antarctica are clustered around the coasts and islands, where the ocean waters provide them with plenty of food.
                                                        Just as in the Arctic, the main source of food for many animals is plankton. Phytoplankton and zooplankton thrive in the Antarctic, due to nutrient-rich currents and upwellings that swirl through the cold waters. Fish throng the waters, feeding on the zooplankton. Whales also migrate to the Antarctic to feed on vast quantities of krill. Despite its name, the crabeater seal also feeds almost entirely on krill—the only seal to do so.
                                                        Other seals and penguins dive after fish, while sea birds such as albatrosses and terns pluck the fish from the surface. Penguins and seals come out on to land to breed or rest, but when they return to the water, they are in danger from hunting killer whales and the ferocious leopard seal.
                                                        Antarctic animals are specially adapted to survive the cold, icy conditions and winds of up to 200 kilometres per hour. They have thick fur or feathers, and many also have a layer of fat, called blubber, to keep them warm. Some insects can survive being frozen during winter and defrosted in summer, while some kinds of fish have a natural “anti-freeze” in their blood to stop them freezing in the icy waters.</p>
